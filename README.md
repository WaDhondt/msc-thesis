# msc-thesis
Repo containing scripts and files for my msc thesis 


- `01-structural_analysis` contains files relating to the conservation binding site residues (PDBePISA files, alignment)


- `02-model_building` contains the notebooks used to create homology models of the human Cav1.1 channel with Modeller. Also contains the edited pdb files used for the simulation later on.
